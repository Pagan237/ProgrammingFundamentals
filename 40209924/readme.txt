Readme file for makefile

The makefile is used to turn the binary_tree.cpp file into a library as it contains all the functions used in the test application and no main
therefore it makes more sense for it to be a library, it also performs the standard operations you would expect from a makefile (compiling, cleaning, etc)


The toolchain used to build the makefile is the command prompt from visual studio 2013
